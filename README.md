# CHC cleaning scripts

These are R scripts that carry out cleaning on the children's social care (CSC) data in ECHILD (CLA and CiN data). The scripts result in more-or-less analysis ready datasets, though users should insepct the scripts and documentation (which includes a variable list, available on the SRS) for further details and consider whether any further cleaning is required.
